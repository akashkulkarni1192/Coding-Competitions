Earlier the maximize minimize and close button were left


After this command,

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout ':minimize,maximize,close'

it got moved to right ..


Here ':' indicates middle of the window.. so with respect to that ':right' and 'left:' is there.. Hence minimize,maximize,close are placed accordingly
