First i will be logging into the server using ssh tool as root(ssh client), say Server ip address is 10.49.0.254

ssh root@10.49.0.254

Then i enter my username and password and connect to server

Say, I know the username of my friend..I will check the details of all the users connected to this server using command

w

Then i check the terminal name of the corresponding username ...(In the pic, since i am not connected to any server, It shows only me as client). Say, the terminal name is /dev/pts/4

sudo echo "Tell me the answer for this question !!!" > /dev/pts/4
