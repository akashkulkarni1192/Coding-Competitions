First i inserted a pendrive
It got mounted automatically
u used this command to check details of all the mounted devices to find the path of the device drive under my file system

sudo fdisk -l
It was /dev/sdb

I unmounted it using command 

sudo umount /dev/sdb

Then i created a directory in /media/usb , using

sudo mkdir /media/usb

Then i mounted it back using 

sudo mount /dev/sdb /media/usb
