For updating a grub splash screen, Screen should be made compatible to its format..
Image should be utmost 640 x 480 pixels in size and It can contain maximum 14 colours 

So for that , I took an image say batman.jpg , Converted into required format..

convert -resize 640x480 -colors 14 batman.xpm batmannew.xpm

I copied this image into /boot/grub folder, using command

sudo cp batmannew.xpm /boot/grub

Then i changed the grub configuration file ....

sudo vim /etc/default/grub

Added one line in it

GRUB_BACKGROUND=/boot/grub/batmannew.xpm

Saved it ..and updated the grub...

sudo update-grub...
Restarted...the system
