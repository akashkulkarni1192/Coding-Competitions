First i downloaded the vlc-2.1.5.tar.xz (VLC media player source code) from the http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-sources.html site

i decompressed it using 

tar -xf vlc-2.1.5.tar.xz

then i moved to that directory

cd vlc-2.1.5

Then i ran following commands
	
./bootstrap			
./configures 		[This shell script configures it ]
make				[This builds the VLC]
make install		[Installs the vlc and its plugins]

Then i launched the vlc from current directory using

./vlc
