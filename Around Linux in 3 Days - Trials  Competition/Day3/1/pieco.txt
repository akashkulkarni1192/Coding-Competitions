I can retrieve content from any website using 'wget' command. But it shows bulk of unnecessary output.. So i used 

wget -q google.com

-q option turns off its output..

So using these concepts ..i wrote it in a shell script..
if the exit status (stored in $? variable) is 0, command succesful -> then net connected
else , not




EVERY COMMAND SHOWN IN LEFT SIDE
